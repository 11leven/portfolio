Project1 - Predict Student Performance in Exams.

Factors effecting student performance from analysis is evident with nationality (Jordan nationals) performed better, working on Chemistry, and having relation with mother has positive effect on the levels. While being male, participate(less) in discussion and absence more than 7days has negative effect on the scores. 
Random Forest Classification at 74% is more suited for the data set in predicting students’ performance. 

Project2 - Predicting failure of APS brake systems in trucks.

Post cleansing data issues with missing values of highly imbalanced data, smoothening the data, feature engineering has produced a reasonable prediction of positive APS failure or not related to APS brake failure. Detection of a failure in an APS of trucks could save fleet owners quite a bit of repair cost, maintenance, and loss of productivity. Although the meaning of the faults is not known from this data set, a detail decoding of the features would help prediction of a fault only even for the histograms (buckets) that are provided/available. 

Project3 - Sentiment Analysis of Phones sold on Amazon.

Generalizing the review dataset and understanding the final outputs sentiment values of ratings and make normalizations among those rating reviews is the main assumption. Given the amount i.e 65% of neutral mean values we got in sentiment analysis and the number of neutral ratings (value 3) among the overall ratings, it is very helpful to business to take these values and strive towards improving the ratings to positive. Also, in predicting the rating values based on text values among blogs and other social media sites, that don’t have necessarily a rating.
